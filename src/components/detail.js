        The long held idiom “reaching for the moon” was a dream realized as India’s Chandrayan 3 landed on the south pole of the lunar surface at 6.03 pm on August 23, 2023. Year 2023 will always be remembered for the remarkable achievement of India completing this space odyssey. Early 2024, ISRO could also successfully insert Aditya L1 solar observatory into Halo orbit around the sun-earth point L1.In fact, ISRO’s missions taught all of us how to aim for the stars believing in our own abilities and learning from failures. We are also proud of our DRDO scientists for Mission Divyastra, the first flight test of indigenously developed Agni-5 missile with Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV) technology.

India’s space sector achievements emphasize the significance of core engineering fields and hope this will sow the seeds of change in mindset of engineering students to choose courses for their study accordingly. The celebration of the Chandrayan Mahotsav on 4th September by our first year students inspired them to think in this direction.

Year 2023-24 marked many major achievements for our institution also. VESIT was conferred “Autonomous Status” by UGC for a period of 10 years. We were also privileged to be amongst the first few Higher Education Institutions to implement the New National Education Policy – 2020 in Maharashtra state. VESIT has been also rated AAA+, by CAREERS 360 in India’s Best Engineering Institutions Survey 2023. Education World Pvt. Ltd. has ranked our institute as Second Best Private Engineering Institute in Maharashtra State.
